Bank Customer Data Management and Interest Calculation

This Java program manages customer data for ABC Bank using a contiguous list data structure. The program includes the following features:

Data Input & Display: Captures and displays customer account details.
Interest Calculation: Computes interest based on account balances and the bank's predefined interest rates.
Total Balance Calculation: Updates customer account balances after one year by adding the earned interest.
Sorting: Utilizes the quick sort algorithm to sort customers based on their total account balances.
High Balance Customers: Identifies and displays customers with account balances exceeding Rs. 1,000,000 after one year.
Savings Account Analysis: Calculates and displays the total balance in savings accounts and determines the percentage of this total relative to the combined balance of all accounts.
This program demonstrates how to use contiguous list data structures to efficiently manage and process customer banking data
